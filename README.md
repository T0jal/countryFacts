# Country Facts

This project was created based on the challenge of Day 59 of the 100 Days of Swift by Hacking With Swift (Paul Hudson).

The challenge was to develop an iOS App that would fetch data from an API and then show it to the user. The data in this case was country facts.

The idea was to have a clickable list of countries and then a second screen where the specific data of a country would be displayed.

You can check the actual challenge page on the references.
